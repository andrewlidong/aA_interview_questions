# Cyclic

Write a function cyclic(head) which will return true if a list is cyclic.  You may use O(N) memory initially, though ideally we'd like to write an O(1) memory version.  

In a linked list, each link holds a next reference to the next item in the list, except for the final link, which points to nil.  A list is cyclic if it loops back on itself.
