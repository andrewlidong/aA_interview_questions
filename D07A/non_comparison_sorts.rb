# Non-Comparison Sorts
# Note to interviewer: These questions build on each other. Wait for a satisfactory answer before continuing to a new part.
#
# Part 1: You are given an array of length n, containing the numbers 1..n in shuffled order. "Sort" this array in O(n) time.
#
# Part 2: You are given an array of length n with numbers in the range 1..N (N >= n). Sort this array in O(n + N) time. You may use O(N) memory.
#
# Part 3: You are given an array of n strings, each of length k.
#
# Sort the strings in O(kn). Hint: do not compare any two strings. You may assume all strings contain only lowercase letters a..z without whitespace or punctuation.
