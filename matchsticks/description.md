# Matchsticks

You have two sticks and a matchbox.  Each stick takes exactly an hour to burn from one end to the other.  

The sticks don't burn at a steady rate.  If you break a stick in half, it is not guaranteed that each half will take 30 minutes to burn.  

How would you measure exactly 45 minutes by burning these sticks?
