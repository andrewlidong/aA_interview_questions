Matchsticks
You have two sticks and a matchbox. Each stick takes exactly an hour to burn from one end to the other.

The sticks are weird, in that they do not burn at a steady. If you break a stick in half, it is not guaranteed that each half will take 30min to burn.

How would you measure exactly 45 minutes by burning these sticks?

Take stick1, light it at both ends. At the same time, light stick2 at
one end.

When stick1 is extinguished, 30min have passed. Now, light stick2 at
the other end. The stick will take another 15min to finish burning.
