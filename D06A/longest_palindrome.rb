# longest_palindrome
# Write a function that will take a string and return the indices of the start/end of the longest palindrome it contains.
#
# Your palindrome checker could reverse the string and compare it to the original, but that takes extra memory (that takes O(n) extra memory). Instead, you should be able to solve this problem with O(1) memory.
#
# The naive solution is to generate all of the substrings (of which there are O(n**2) many), and for each substring, check if it's a palindrome. A palindrome check takes linear time, so this is total O(n**3) time, or cubic time.
