Introduction:

Tell me about your background.

(You are applying to an online clothing boutique)

Your Toolbox:

I see that you've used {Tool X}. What did you like about it, and what did you dislike about it?  

(Tool x can be any language, library, or framework that you have significant experience with.  Examples include Rails, React, Redux, etc.)

Your answer should include the following:

- How you used this tool
- A specific example of something you thought the tool did really well/what you liked about using it
- A specific example of something you didn't like about using it (comparing it to other tools that do similar things is fine and encouraged)
