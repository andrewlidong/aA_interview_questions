Introduction:

Tell me about your career path up to this point.

(Assume you are applying to an early stage startup that builds a platform to help nonprofits collect donations)

Being Managed:

Describe a time you disagreed with your manager and how you handled it.  

(If you haven't been employed, replace 'manager' with another authority figure like a professor or teacher)
