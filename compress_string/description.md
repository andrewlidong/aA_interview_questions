# Compress String

Write a function that takes a string and compresses it.  Case matters (ex. "aa" => "a2", "aA" => "aA").  Do not compress a character if there is only one in a row.  

Examples:

```rb
compress("aaa") # => "a3"
compress("abbccc") # => "ab2c3"
```

Hint: How can you change a string into an integer.
