Introduction:

Tell me about yourself

(Assume you're applying to Lyft)

Epic Fail:

What was your biggest failure?

The answer should tell the interviewer the following:

- What was the context for the situation that led to the failure?

- What lead up to the failure?  

- What, specifically, was the failure?  

- How did you recover from this failure?  What was the eventual outcome?
