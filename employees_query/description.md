# Employees Query

In a SQL db, you have two tables, an employees table and a departments table. Employees belong to only one department. Write a SQL query that returns the number of employees per department.

Clarifications:

Column names are not important, just agree on something semantic
Follow-up questions:

What happens if a department has no employees?
Why do we need a LEFT OUTER JOIN?
