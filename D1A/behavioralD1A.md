Introduction:

Walk me through your background.  

(Do your personal pitch.  Assume you are applying to a small startup.)

  I graduated from the University of Chicago two years ago with a bachelors in mathematics.  However, professionally I knew I wanted to do something creative, exciting and physical, and while I was in school I held a job at a very well-respected kitchen in Chicago, at the time it was the only Michelin-recommended restaurant on the South Side.  I decided to pursue cooking professionally and did quite well, doing stages really all over the country before ultimately anding in NYC at Daniel Boulud's Restaurant Daniel.  After giving it an honest shot, I realized I wouldn't be able to hold up physically in the long run and started looking at other potential careers.  (part of what made me such a promising chef was my physical and mental endurance - able to work long hours and do whatever is asked of me).  I tried a myriad of jobs after this, including teaching at a learning center, working as a sales analyst for a healthcare company, becoming a spin instructor, rock climbing instructor and a referee.  Before long I was suggested software development by a friend.  I had taken an honors introductory sequence at my college and had done quite well but couldn't see myself feeling comfortable doing it professionally without going back to school.  This was a serious fiscal challenge for me but fortunately I was able to do a coding bootcamp, App Academy, at no up-front cost.  I've since graduated and am looking for my first proper job in development.

(This may change from company to company slightly, but you should be able to answer it based on your values)

  When I start work on a project, particularly if it's something experiential and client-facing, I am very driven toward making it as perfect as possible, almost to a fault.  From working in so many different roles and places in the past I'm very adaptable as a teammate and get along with people exceptionally well.  I also understand how fundamentally important this is.  Finally, I'm able to make connections and insights into user experience that someone coming from a more traditional background might not be able to.
