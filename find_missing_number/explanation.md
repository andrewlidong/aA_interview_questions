# Find Missing Number

### High level idea

Simply take the sum of the first and the sum of the second, and return the difference between the two.  

### Time and space complexity

Let: <br>

- `n1` be the size of array 1 <br>
- `n2` be the size of array 2 <br>

Worst cases: <br>

- Time: `O(n1 + n2)` <br>
- Space: `O(1)`

### Edge cases missed
