# Find Missing Number

Write a function which takes an array of non-negative integers, and a second array wherein the elements of the first array are shuffled and a random element is deleted.  Find the element that is missing in the second array, in linear time with constant memory usage.  

Examples:

```rb
arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
arr2 = [3,2,1,5,6]

find_missing_number(arr1, arr2) # => 4
```
