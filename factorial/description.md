# Factorial

Implement factorial with and without recursion.  What is a potential disadavntage of the recursive way?  

What is tail-recursion?  Does Ruby have tail-call optimization?  Pretend it does - write a tail-recursive version of recursive factorial.  

Examples:

```rb
iter_fac(5) # => 120
tail_rec_fac(1) # => 1
```

```js
iter_fac(5) // => 120
tail_rec_fac(1) // => 1
```
