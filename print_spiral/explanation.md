### High level idea

First duplicate the array.  Initialize a results array.  Traverse the array, eliminating elements and pushing them into our results array until the width or the height is 0.  

### Time and space complexity

Let: <br>

- `n` be the number of elements in the matrix<br>

Worst cases: <br>

- Time: `O(n)` <br>
- Space: `O(n)`

### Edge cases missed
