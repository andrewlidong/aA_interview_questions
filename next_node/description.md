# Next Node

Given a node in a Binary Search Tree, find the next node in the tree.  In this case, we can think of ordering being an in-order traversal of the tree where next is the smallest node value which is greater than or equal to the given node. 

Assume you don't have the root of the tree, just a single node from it.
