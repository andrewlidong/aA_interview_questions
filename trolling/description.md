# Troll Toll

You are on your way to visit your Grandma, who lives at the end of the valley.

It's her birthday, and you want to give her the cakes you've made.

Between your house and her house, you have to cross 7 bridges
There is a troll under every bridge!

Each troll insists that you have to give them half of the cakes you are carrying.  

They are kind trolls, so they each give you back a single cake.  

How many cakes do you have to leave home with to make sure that you arrive at Grandma's with exactly 2 cakes?

Note: 

Trolls deal in integer division (there are no fractions)
