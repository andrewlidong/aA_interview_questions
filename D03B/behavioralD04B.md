Introduction:

Tell me a bit about who you are.  

(Applying to an online clothing boutique)

Works Well With Others:

What kind of work culture are you looking for?  

Your answer should include:

- Something specific about a past work culture (which can include a/A)

- Your ideal work environment and why you would thrive

(Avoid appearing as though you need an excessive amount of direction.  Emphasize how these environments have enabled you to succeed)
