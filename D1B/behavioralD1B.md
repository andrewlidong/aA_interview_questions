Introduction:

Walk me through your background.

(Do your personal pitch.  You're applying for a front end position at an adtech company)

I graduated from the University of Chicago two years ago with a bachelors in mathematics.  Professionally I knew I wanted to do something creative, exciting and physical, and while I was in school I held a cooking job at a very well-respected restaurant in Chicago, at the time the only Michelin-recommended restaurant on the South Side.  I decided to pursue cooking professionally and did quite well, performing stages really all over the country before ultimately ending up in NYC at Daniel Boulud's Restaurant Daniel.  After giving it an honest shot, I realized I wouldn't be able to hold up physically in the long run and started looking at other potential careers.  (part of what made me such a promising chef was my physical and mental endurance - the ability to work long hours and do whatever was asked of me).  I tried a myriad of jobs after this, including teaching at a learning center, working as a sales analyst for a healthcare company, becoming a spin instructor, rock climbing instructor and a referee.  Before long I was suggested software development by a friend.  I had taken the honors introductory sequence at The University of Chicago and had done quite well but couldn't see myself feeling comfortable doing it professionally without going back to school.  This was a serious fiscal challenge for me but fortunately I was able to do a coding bootcamp, App Academy, at no up-front cost.  I've since graduated and am looking for my first proper job in development.
