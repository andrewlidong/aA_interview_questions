# Fibonacci

Write a function which returns the first n elements from the Fibonacci sequence.  

A reminder, the fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: 

0,1,1,2,3,5,...

with the kth element being: f(k) = f(k - 1) + f(k - 2)

Solve this both recursively and iteratively.  

Examples:

```rb
fibs(4) # => 0,1,1,2
fib_rec(4) # => 0,1,1,2
```

```js
fibs(4) // => 0,1,1,2
fib_rec(4) // => 0,1,1,2
```
