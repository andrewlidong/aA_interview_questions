# Weighted random index

Given an array, write a function that will return a random index of the array.  The probability of an index being return is weighted by the value at that index against the sum of the array values.  

For example, for the array [4,6,8], index 0 should be returned with 4 in 18 odds, 1 should be returned with 6 in 18 odds, and index 2 should be returned with 8 in 18 odds.
