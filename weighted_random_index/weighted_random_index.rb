# weighted_random_index
# Given an array, write a function that will return a random index of the array. The probability of an index being returned is weighted by the value at that index against the sum of the array values. For example, for the array [4, 6, 8], index 0 should be returned with 4 in 18 odds, index 1 should be returned with 6 in 18 odds, and index 2 should be return with 8 in 18 odds. Implement this in O(n) time.

def weighted_random_index(arr)
  total_sum = arr.inject(:+)
  value = rand(total_sum)

  cumulative_sum = 0
  arr.each_with_index do |el, i|
    cumulative_sum += el
    return i if value < cumulative_sum
  end
end
