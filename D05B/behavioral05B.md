Introduction:

What kind of position are you looking for (frontend, backend, fullstack)?  Why?  

(Assume you are applying to Lyft)

Hindsight:

What would you do differently if you had to do [Project X] over again?

(Project X should be your fullstack project)

The answer should tell the interviewer:

- What the project was (concisely)
- A description of what you did that wasn't ideal
- A description of how you would do that differently, including an explanation of why (what did you learn after the project)
