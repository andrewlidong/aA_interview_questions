# Choose a Record

Write a method chooseARecord(data) that takes a hash of symbol keys, for which the values are integers representing each key's weight.  The method then returns a key such that the chances of selecting a particular key are weighted by that key's values.  

Examples:

```js
const hsh = { a:1, b:2, c:3 };
chooseARecord(hsh) 
```
