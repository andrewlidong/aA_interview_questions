# Largest Contiguous Subsum

Write a function that takes an array of integers and find the largest sum of a subarray.  Try to solve this in linear time with constant memory.  Array integers are positive and negative.  

Examples:

```rb
arr = [5,3,-7, 6, 4]
largest_contiguous_subsum(arr) # => 11
```
