Introduction:

Give me a summary of who you are and what you've done.
(assume you're applying to Airbnb)

Bugged Out:

Tell me about the hardest bug you've ever resolved.

Your answer should be a narrative that the interviewer can easily follow:

- Summarize the bug
  - The project you were working on
  - the desired behavior vs what was happening
  - Technical details as are necessary

- What did you try?  What didn't work?  

- What did you discover was causing the bug?  

- What did you learn?  How did this make you a better developer?
