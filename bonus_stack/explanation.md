# Bonus Stack

### High level idea

Build a class MaxStack, with a constructor of values as an array.  

Next build a method taking a value which pushes in a tuple with first index being value, second index being max.  

Build a pop method taking no arguments, which pops from the array of values.  

Build a max function which returns the second tuple value of the last element in the stack.
