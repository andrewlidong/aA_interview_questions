Write the following queries in SQL and ActiveRecord:

# Count all users

SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM
  users;

User.count

# Count all active users
(It's up to them what 'active' means)

SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM
  users
WHERE
  users.active = true;

User.where(:active => true).count

# Count all users who've visited the site within a certain time period

SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM
  users
WHERE
  users.last_login BETWEEN :time_period_start AND :time_period_end;

User.where(last_login: (time_period_start..time_period_end)).count
