# Connected Components

### High level idea

First, read the lines of the file.  Initialize a matrix hash.  On each line, split the vertices and push values into 

### Time and space complexity

Let: <br>

- `n` be the number of edges (lines)<br>

Worst cases: <br>

- Time: `O(N)` <br>
- Space: `O(N)`

### Edge cases missed
